# Open-Edvidence

Open-Edvidence is an open-source interface that connects large language models (LLMs) with educational research data. The project aims to make educational scholarship, datasets, and metadata more accessible, explorable, and reusable—bridging the gap between AI reasoning and the evidence base of education.
